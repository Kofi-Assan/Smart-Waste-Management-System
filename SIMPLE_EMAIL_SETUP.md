# Simple Email Setup Guide

## âœ… Email System - No Configuration Required!

The email system now works with **ANY email address** (real or fake) without any authentication setup.

## How It Works:

1. **No Setup Required** - Just start the server
2. **Works with Any Email** - Real or fake addresses
3. **Always Succeeds** - No authentication errors
4. **Console Logging** - See email content in server logs

## Quick Start:

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Expected output**:
   ```
   âœ… Database connected successfully
   âœ… Tables created successfully
   âœ… Database initialized successfully
   âœ… Email service ready (Demo Mode)
   ðŸ“§ Emails will be "sent" to any address
   ðŸ’¡ Check console logs for email content
   ðŸš€ Server running on http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Test with Postman**:
   - Redeem a reward
   - Check server console for email content
