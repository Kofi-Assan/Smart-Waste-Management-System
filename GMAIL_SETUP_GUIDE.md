# Gmail Email Setup Guide

## Quick Fix for "Invalid login: 535-5.7.8" Error

3. Turn it ON
4. Use your regular Gmail password

**Update your .env file:**
```env

```

### Option 2: App Password (2FA Required) üîí MORE SECURE

**Steps:**
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication
2. Generate App Password
3. Use the 16-character app password

## Test Email Functionality:
1. Use the Postman collection to redeem a reward
2. Check your email for the confirmation message
3. The email should arrive within 1-2 minutes

## Troubleshooting:

**Still getting 535 error?**
- Try Method 1 first (regular password)
- If that fails, use Method 2 (app password)
- Double-check the email address is correct

**"Less secure app access" not available?**
- Google may have removed this option
- Use Method 2 (App Password) instead

**No email received?**
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify the recipient email in the API request
- Check server logs for email sending status

## Alternative Email Providers:

### Outlook/Hotmail:
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp-mail.outlook.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@outlook.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-password
```

### Yahoo:
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.mail.yahoo.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@yahoo.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```

## Note:
The reward redemption system works perfectly even without email configuration. Users will still get their rewards processed, they just won't receive email confirmations.
